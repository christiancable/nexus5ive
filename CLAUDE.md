# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Nexus5ive is a Laravel 12 BBS (Bulletin Board System) that has been running since 2001. It uses PHP 8.2+, Livewire 3.5 for real-time components, Bootstrap 5.3 for styling, and Vite for asset bundling.

## Development Commands

This project uses Laravel Sail (Docker). Prefix commands with `./vendor/bin/sail`:

```bash
# Testing
sail test                                                               # Unit and feature tests
sail php vendor/bin/pest --browser chrome tests/Browser/               # Browser tests (Playwright)
sail php vendor/bin/pest --browser chrome tests/Browser/LoginTest.php  # Single browser test file

# Code quality
sail pint app                  # Format PHP code (Laravel Pint)
sail npm run larastan          # Static analysis (PHPStan level 5)

# Frontend
sail npm run dev                    # Vite watch mode
sail npm run build                  # Production build
```

Without Sail:
```bash
php artisan test
php vendor/bin/pest --browser chrome tests/Browser/
vendor/bin/pint app
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
```

## Architecture

**Core Domain Models** (in `app/Models/`):
- **Section** - Forum categories (hierarchical)
- **Topic** - Discussion threads within sections
- **Post** - Posts within a Topic
- **User** - Users of the BBS
- **Comment** - Comments on a user's profile page
- **View** - Tracks which posts users have read

**Key Patterns**:
- Form Request classes handle validation AND authorization (`app/Http/Requests/Nexus/`)
- Policies provide gate-based authorization (`app/Policies/`)
- Helper classes extract business logic (`app/Helpers/`) - ViewHelper, ActivityHelper, BreadcrumbHelper, NxCodeHelper
- Events trigger cache invalidation (`TreeCacheBecameDirty`, `MostRecentPostForSectionBecameDirty`)
- Livewire components power real-time features: Chat, Mentions, Settings, Search (`app/Livewire/`)

**Controllers** are RESTful and located in `app/Http/Controllers/Nexus/`.

## Configuration

BBS-specific settings are in `config/nexus.php`. Key env vars:
- `NEXUS_NAME` - Site name
- `NEXUS_ADMIN_EMAIL` - Admin contact
- `NEXUS_ALLOW_REGISTRATIONS` - Enable/disable signups
- `NEXUS_PAGINATION` - Items per page

## Artisan Commands

```bash
php artisan nexus:install      # Initialize BBS
php artisan nexus:theme add --name=Excelsior --path='/css/excelsior.css'
php artisan nexus:theme remove --name=minty
php artisan nexus:unverified   # List unverified users
```

## Git Workflow

- `master` branch is production (deployed)
- Create feature branches from `develop`
- Run `sail artisan test && sail php vendor/bin/pest --browser chrome tests/Browser/` before PRs
- License: GNU GPL v2

- php - 8.3
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/pail (PAIL) - v1
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- livewire/livewire (LIVEWIRE) - v3
- larastan/larastan (LARASTAN) - v3

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `laravel-best-practices` — Apply this skill whenever writing, reviewing, or refactoring Laravel PHP code. This includes creating or modifying controllers, models, migrations, form requests, policies, jobs, scheduled commands, service classes, and Eloquent queries. Triggers for N+1 and query performance issues, caching strategies, authorization and security patterns, validation, error handling, queue and job configuration, route definitions, and architectural decisions. Also use for Laravel code reviews and refactoring existing Laravel code to follow best practices. Covers any task involving Laravel backend PHP code patterns.
- `livewire-development` — Use for any task or question involving Livewire. Activate if user mentions Livewire, wire: directives, or Livewire-specific concepts like wire:model, wire:click, invoke this skill. Covers building new components, debugging reactivity issues, real-time form validation, loading states, migrating from Livewire 2 to 3, converting component formats (SFC/MFC/class-based), and performance optimization. Do not use for non-Livewire reactive UI (React, Vue, Alpine-only, Inertia.js) or standard Laravel forms without Livewire.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `vendor/bin/sail npm run build`, `vendor/bin/sail npm run dev`, or `vendor/bin/sail composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `vendor/bin/sail artisan route:list`). Use `vendor/bin/sail artisan list` to discover available commands and `vendor/bin/sail artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `vendor/bin/sail artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `vendor/bin/sail artisan config:show app.name`, `vendor/bin/sail artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.
- To check environment variables, read the `.env` file directly.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `vendor/bin/sail artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `vendor/bin/sail artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== sail rules ===

# Laravel Sail

- This project runs inside Laravel Sail's Docker containers. You MUST execute all commands through Sail.
- Start services using `vendor/bin/sail up -d` and stop them with `vendor/bin/sail stop`.
- Open the application in the browser by running `vendor/bin/sail open`.
- Always prefix PHP, Artisan, Composer, and Node commands with `vendor/bin/sail`. Examples:
    - Run Artisan Commands: `vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate`
    - Install Composer packages: `vendor/bin/sail composer install`
    - Execute Node commands: `vendor/bin/sail npm run dev`
    - Execute PHP scripts: `vendor/bin/sail php [script]`
- View all available Sail commands by running `vendor/bin/sail` without arguments.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `vendor/bin/sail artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `vendor/bin/sail artisan list` and check their parameters with `vendor/bin/sail artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `vendor/bin/sail npm run build` or ask the user to run `vendor/bin/sail npm run dev` or `vendor/bin/sail composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

## Laravel 12 Structure

- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app/Console/Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allow to build dynamic, reactive interfaces in PHP without writing JavaScript.
- You can use Alpine.js for client-side interactions instead of JavaScript frameworks.
- Keep state server-side so the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions as you would in HTTP requests.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/sail bin pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/sail bin pint --test`, simply run `vendor/bin/sail bin pint` to fix any formatting issues.

=== phpunit/core rules ===

# PHPUnit

- This application uses PHPUnit for testing. All tests must be written as PHPUnit classes. Use `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:test --phpunit {name}` to create a new test.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When the tests relating to your feature are passing, ask the user if they would like to also run the entire test suite to make sure everything is still passing.
- Tests should cover all happy paths, failure paths, and edge cases.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files; these are core to the application.

## Running Tests

- Run the minimal number of tests, using an appropriate filter, before finalizing.
- To run all tests: `vendor/bin/sail artisan test --compact`.
- To run all tests in a file: `vendor/bin/sail artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `vendor/bin/sail artisan test --compact --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).
