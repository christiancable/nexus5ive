# modes

nexus has many nodes - only one node is the active mode

a node has
    - id
    - name
    - welcome text
    - zero or one theme

the active node is selected by a sysop and if the selected node contains a theme then this overrides any used selected theme

examples

    node:
        name: christmas
        theme: christmas
        welcome message: 'ho ho ho'

        name: halloween
        theme: halloween
        welcome message: 

        name: default
        theme: none
        welcome message: 

There are those who believe that spodding here began out there, far across the network, with tribes of users who may have been the forefathers of the Prestoneites, or the Facebookers, or the Twitters.

That they may have been the architects of the great forums, or the lost civilizations of Monochrome or anonyMUD. Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man who even now fight to survive somewhere beyond the screenâ€¦

administrations get an admin section

/admin
    - select mode
    - edit mode fields
    - save
    - create new mode


the db seed OR nexus install should create the default node

test
    - normal user cannot visit /admin
    - sysop can visit /admin
    

forms

    we should have a way to name the multiple forms which could be on a page

    Sections
        "Section{$section->id}"

    Posts
        "Post{$post->id}"

clean up the names of the forms we have
