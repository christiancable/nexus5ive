# Contributing to Nexus5ive
Thank you for taking an interest in this project!

This has been a solo-project since 2001 and this contributing guide is *very* new. Please feel free to send me suggestions on how to improve guide or better yet, make a pull request with improvements. 

I want to make it easy to contribute. This is a small project and I'd welcome any help you can give, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

The [Readme](readme.md) has an overview of the project and how to install the application. 

## Develop with Github
I use github to host the code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

* Project Roadmap at https://github.com/christiancable/nexus5ive/projects/2
* View issues with ['Help wanted'](https://github.com/christiancable/nexus5ive/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

Feel free to contact me on the issue on Github if you want to work on any specific one.

### How to make changes
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. 

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code meets the Coding Standard (currently PRS2).

I use the `master` branch for the current deployed version of this application. 

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPLv2 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU GPL v2](LICENCE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/christiancable/nexus5ive/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

I *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Coding Standards
I use PSR2 for all the PHP in this project.

* You can run `yarn phpcs` for to check all the code within the app directory.
