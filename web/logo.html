<p>nexus is an internet community that originated in the north-west of england 
  but now has users across the uk</p>
<p>we are mostly children of the eighties, disinterested in the mainstream - we 
  like to come here to chat about music, films, tv, comics, nerdy stuff, and just 
  life in general</p>
<p>we're always happy to see new faces, however we are currently closed for &quot;redecorating&quot;<br>
</p>
