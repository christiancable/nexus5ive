There are those who believe... that life here... began out there. Far across the internet. With the tribes of Nexus... who may have been the forefathers of the Lancastrians... or the Prestonians... or the Bradfordites... that they may have been the architects of the Valis Tapes... or the lost civilizations of Spodsville... or AreaOrange... Some believe that there may yet be brothers of nexus... who even now fight to survive... somewhere beyond academicia.
